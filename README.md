FrontierCO is a curated benchmark suite for evaluating ML-based solvers on large-scale and real-world Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. The benchmark spans 8 classical CO problems across 5 application domains, providing both training and evaluation instances specifically designed to test the contemporary ML-based CO solvers in solving NP-hard problems.

Combinatorial optimization plays a fundamental role in discrete mathematics, computer science, and operations research, with applications in routing, scheduling, allocation, and more. As ML-based solvers evolve—ranging from neural networks to symbolic reasoning with large language models—FrontierCO offers the first comprehensive dataset suite tailored to test these solvers at realistic scales and difficulties.

# Classical Solvers and Neural Training Data

Please refer to the instructions under each problem folder under [data](https://github.com/sunnweiwei/FrontierCO/tree/main/data) for how to: 

- apply the human-designed classical solvers 
- generate the training data for neural solvers 

All the neural solvers evaluated in this work are open-sourced models. Please refer to their official GitHub repos for the training and evaluation code.

# Neural Solver Evaluation

TBD

# Agent Evaluation

Check out [Evaluation-on-Frontierco](https://github.com/sunnweiwei/CO-Bench?tab=readme-ov-file#evaluation-on-frontierco)

Below is code to run evaluation of *Greedy Refinement* agent on `CFLP` for 64 iterations with 300s timeout.

```python
# We use new agent implementations in FrontierCO:
from agents import YieldGreedyRefine, YieldFunSearch, YieldReEvo

# And a new evaluator to fetch solutions yielded by the solver,
# evaluating only the last solution before timeout:
from evaluation import YieldingEvaluator, get_new_data

# Load data
data = get_new_data(task, src_dir='data', data_dir='data')

# Define agent (example: YieldGreedyRefine)
agent = YieldGreedyRefine(
    problem_description=data.problem_description,
    timeout=300,  # 300s timeout during solver development
    model='openai/o3-mini',  # We use LiteLLM to call the API
)

# Load YieldingEvaluator
# 300s timeout during solver development
evaluator = YieldingEvaluator(data, timeout=300)

# Run for 64 iterations
for it in range(64):
    code = agent.step()
    if code is None:  # agent decides to terminate
        break
    feedback = evaluator.evaluate(code)  # Run evaluation
    agent.feedback(feedback.dev_score, feedback.dev_feedback)  # Use dev set score as feedback

# Get the final solution
code = agent.finalize()

# For final evaluation, run the solver for 1 hour
final_evaluator = YieldingEvaluator(data, timeout=60 * 60)
feedback = final_evaluator.evaluate(code)
print(feedback.test_feedback)  # Test set score
```

# Agent Implementations

Agents are implemented in the `agents` module. Currently supported agents include: `GreedyRefine`, `DirectAnswer`, `BestOfN`, `FunSearch` ([link](https://github.com/google-deepmind/funsearch)), `AIDE` ([link](https://github.com/WecoAI/aideml)), `ChainOfExperts` ([link](https://github.com/xzymustbexzy/Chain-of-Experts)), and `ReEvo` ([link](https://github.com/ai4co/reevo)). LLMs are supported via [liteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm).

Each agent implements the following functions:
- `step()`: Returns the next candidate code for evaluation.
