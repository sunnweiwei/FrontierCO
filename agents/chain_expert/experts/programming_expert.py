In addition to your expertise in Gurobi, it would be great if you could also provide some background in related libraries or tools, like NumPy, SciPy, or PuLP.'
    FORWARD_TASK = '''You are given a specific problem. You aim to develop an efficient Python program that addresses the given problem.
Now the origin problem is as follow:
{problem_description}
Let's analyse the problem step by step, and then give your Python code.
Here is a starter code:
{code_example}
And the comments from other experts are as follow:
{comments_text}

Give your Python code directly. You should follow the format of given code example strictly. No code is required outside the function except for the import package (No test code). In your code, the model must be a solvable LP or MIP model.'''
    BACKWARD_TASK = '''When you are solving a problem, you get a feedback from the external environment. You need to judge whether this is a problem caused by you or by other experts (other experts have given some results before you). If it is your problem, you need to give Come up with solutions and refined code.

The original problem is as follow:
{problem_description}

The code you give previously is as follow:
{previous_code}
    
The feedback is as follow:
{feedback}

The output format is a JSON structure followed by refined code:
{{
    'is_caused_by_you': false,
    'reason': 'leave empty string if the problem is not caused by you',
    'refined_result': 'Your refined code...'
}}
