DESCRIPTION = '''The Minimum Dominant Set (MDS) problem is a fundamental NP-hard optimization problem in graph theory. Given an undirected graph G = (V, E), where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges, the goal is to find the smallest subset D âŠ† V such that every vertex in V is either in D or adjacent to at least one vertex in D.'''
